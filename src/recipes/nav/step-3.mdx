import {Code as Step3Code} from '@code/nav/step-3';

<RenderCode Code={Step3Code} />

# Use the Hook

## Lets use that hook to get some important calculations

In the rendered result you will see "minWidthAvailable: [number in pixels]". There may be better ways to get this calculation, but this was the route I went.

<br />

## Min width available state

First thing we need to do is create a new useState hook to get and set the minimum width available.

<CodeSnippet
  code={`const [minWidthAvailable, setMinWidthAvailable] = useState<number>(0);`}
/>

## Pre rendered styles

Next we have to render the list at its smallest possible width
to calculate the minimum width available. The way I achieved
this was by first setting position absolute and visibility hidden
so it wont be contained by a parent element and wont be visible to users.

I also set the element I am measuring and all its child elements to flex: '0 0 auto'.

My assumption here is setting both to its smallest possible size and
knowing that the link text can't wrap, this should provide the smallest
possible width this element can take before the links overflow

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
const preRenderedStyles = {
  flex: '0 0 auto',
  position: 'absolute',
  visibility: 'hidden',
  '> *': {
    flex: '0 0 auto',
  },
};
`}
/>

## useLayoutEffect

Last step here is actually calculating that number.
To do this I used useLayoutEffect to calculate the size
before actually rendering it to the user.

I know that useSize() initializes all its measurements with 0
and I initialized minWidthAvailable with the number 0.
So once width is greater than 0, I set the min width available
to that number Since min width available is no longer 0,
this effect will never run again

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
useLayoutEffect(() => {
  if (width > 0 && minWidthAvailable === 0) {
    setMinWidthAvailable(width);
  }
}, [width, minWidthAvailable]);
`}
/>

## Conditionally render element

We now need to remove the pre-rendered styles and instead use our original
styles

Using the same logic as above. If min width available is greater than 0, we
have our calculation and we can render our actual styles

<CodeSnippet
  code={`sx={minWidthAvailable === 0 ? preRenderedStyles : renderedStyles}`}
/>
