# Now wrap it in a parent div

We have our minimum width available and isDropdown calculations working.
To use those calculations, we must first wrap our nav list in another
flex element and calculate its width as well. I know this sounds strange.
Why do we need to calc two elements widths? We must do this because once
we render the nav list as a dropdown, its width will more than likely always
be less than the minimum width available and will never be able to know when
it can become a row of links again.

Since we now have childWidth and parentWidth, we need to refactor our
minimum width available and isDropdown calculations.

We will use child width to get our minimum width available calculation.

And the parent width to decide when our nav list should be rendered as
a dropdown.

Our new parent element will have a red border and very basic styling. "flex: 1 1 auto"

I also updated the width text to include both child and parent widths

(Note: the difference in widths in our display text when both are aligned
is because we have a 3px border on both)
