# That dropdown really isn't dropping down

To fix this, when isDropdown, we should position absolute and set top to
100% so the top lines up with the bottom of its parent element

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
const dropdownStyles = {
  flexDirection: 'column',
  position: 'absolute',
  top: '100%',
};`}
/>
