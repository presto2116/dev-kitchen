# useMemo

When conditionally rendering styles or components, I never like seeing
something something >= something. To add to code readability, sometimes
slapping that logic into a useMemohelps clean up the code and make it
easier to read.

In our previous step we stated: "If min width available is greater than 0,
we have our calculation and we can render our actual styles"

Instead of adding minWidthAvailable === 0 or minWidthAvailable > 0 or
minWidthAvailable !== 0

Why not create a new memoized value that gives us the same result in a
more readable way

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
const isRendered = useMemo<boolean>(() => minWidthAvailable > 0, 
  [minWidthAvailable]
);`}
/>

(Note: you will likely always see isRendered: true in our State Dialog as it is a very quick
calculation)
