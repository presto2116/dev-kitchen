import {Code as Step6Code} from '@code/nav/step-6';

<RenderCode Code={Step6Code} />

# isDropdown

Now that we used useMemo already once, lets use it for something more
useful. Lets create another memoized variable to check for if we should display the list as a
dropdown or not. We have said before if the width of our list is less than the min width
available, we should display our nav in another state

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
const isDropdown = useMemo<boolean>(() => width < minWidthAvailable, [
width,
minWidthAvailable,
]);`}
/>

(Note: we also removed the isRendered display text as it was pretty
useless, and now are displaying isDropdown)
