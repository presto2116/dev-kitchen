import {Code as Step9Code} from '@code/nav/step-9';

<RenderCode Code={Step9Code} />

# Move it to the other side

Our nav will be on the right side of the page with a logo on the left side
so we need to flip our flex layout to match.

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
<Flex
  ref={parentRef}
  sx={{
    flex: '1 1 auto',
    justifyContent: 'flex-end',
    border: (theme: Theme) => \`3px solid \${theme?.colors?.red}\`,
  }}
>`}
/>

(Note: I removed the State dialog below as it is no longer necessary)
