# Change up the link styling

Instead of spacing our links out, lets default it to fill the space available.

<CodeSnippet
  code={`
<Link
  sx={{
    flex: '1 1 auto',
    ml: 3,
  }}
/>`}
/>

flex: '1 1 auto' fills available space and ml: 3 adds some
margin left so they are not completely touching.

This setup allows each link to be larger if space is available
providing a better look and usability.
