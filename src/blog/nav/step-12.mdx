import {Code as Step12Code} from '@code/nav/step-12';

<RenderCode Code={Step12Code} />

# Let's make a website

I have a component that wraps our nav in it's very own website.

<CodeSnippet
  code={`import {WebsiteWrapper} from '@code/nav/website-wrapper';`}
/>

I also removed the borders to make it look official.
