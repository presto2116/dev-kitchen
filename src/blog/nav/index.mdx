# How many navs have you made?

I am sure you have made your fair share and have ran into the same
problem over and over again. Client says the nav will never be altered.
No additional pages will be added to the site map and this pact has been
set in stone.

The first ask is I want to just tweak the name as its too generic right
now. We just need to add only a couple characters to the link label.

You wipe out your measuring stick, measure the carefully set media
queries and say ok, I think I can make it work. Adjust the code here and
there. click save and walla. it fits.

Happy client, happy dev

Then two months later they come back and have restructured their company
and hence need to add two more items to the nav.

You plug in the new code, and now everything is broken, your media
queries are broken, your link styles are broken.

Everything is broken.

Let's not suffer through this issue every again.
